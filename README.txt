This is a simple maven project to be used for building a test. There is a single Main class that controls the
TestNG tests. Using your IDE, run this main class. The tests can be controlled via the etc/testng.xml file.
To disable a test, you can comment out that test in the etc/testng.xml. Only classes/packages/groups specified
in the testng.xml will be run.
